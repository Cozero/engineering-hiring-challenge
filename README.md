# Cozero Senior Software Engineer Technical Challenge

Hey hey!
If you are seeing this is because you just got further in our recruitment process. ðŸ’ª
We hope you enjoy this little exercise!

## Timing

Schedule the time to complete the project on your terms.
Before you start, please drop us a quick email at jan.kratochvil@cozero.io telling us when you expect to complete the project.
This information helps us schedule time for a timely review and follow-up.

Please don't spend more than **eight hours** on the project.

**Things to keep in mind:**

- Feel free to add dependencies that you find necessary.
- We are looking for someone who pays attention to scalability and quality.
- Take your time to think; don't rush it.
- Add any additional improvements to the codebase you'd like. Remember to explain them in PRs.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure you have Docker installed and run the following command in the root directory to start the database.

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

After this, you will get a Postgres instance running in your machine with a `metrics` table containing several rows. _Metrics_ is the main table relevant to the exercise.

2. Next, install dependencies and build the libs you need to run the solution.

```bash
yarn bootstrap
```

3. Lastly, run the backend and frontend using the following commands in two separate terminals.

```bash
cd packages/server; yarn run start:dev
cd packages/client; yarn run start:dev
```

## Exercise

Checkout to a feature branch from the PR branch

1. **Step**

- Take a look at the code (keep in mind that we might not be following standard code patterns) and check if you have any suggestion
- Check the opened PR and comment on the code as you would do in a normal situation

2.  **Step**
    We are looking to develop a dashboard containing reports about our emissions data (`metrics` table) and using a global filter.

          **Tasks**:
          - Create a global filter (fields: companyName and reportedAt)
          - Make the changes that you find needed to the existing table to be part of the dashboard
          - Create the following reports with blazing-fast results:
            - Emissions the month grouped by company name (suggestion: group bar or stacked bar chart)
            - Emissions the year grouped by company name (suggestion: group bar or stacked bar chart)
            - Pie chart with the relative emissions of which company to the platform total emissions (example: Company1-60% Company2-20% Company3-20%)

**Nice to have**

- Error handling strategy
- Frontend enhancement
- Frontend state management
- Improvement suggestions
- Unit and integration tests
